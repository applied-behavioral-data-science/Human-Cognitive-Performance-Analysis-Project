# Behavioral Data Science Collective – Project 1 Overview

## Dataset
Human Cognitive Performance Dataset (80,000 participants)

This dataset includes lifestyle variables such as sleep duration, stress level, screen time, exercise time, caffeine intake, age, and gender, alongside cognitive outcomes such as cognitive score and reaction time.

---

## Project Goal
Explore which daily lifestyle habits show the strongest relationships with cognitive performance.

---

## Shared Research Question
Which lifestyle habits show the strongest relationships with cognitive performance?

---

## Team Variable Assignments
- Carolina — Screen Time
- Umaima — Caffeine Intake
- Byron — Exercise Time
- Maitreya — Stress Level
- Sarah — Sleep Duration

---

## Expected Outputs (Per Person)
Each member will explore their assigned variable and produce:
- distribution analysis
- relationship analysis vs cognitive score
- relationship analysis vs reaction time
- age group breakdown
- gender breakdown
- correlation values (cognitive score + reaction time)
- brief interpretation summary + discussion question

---

## Final Deliverables
- Shared insight report combining all findings
- Optional interactive "Try Your Habits" cognitive score predictor tool

---

## Collaboration Notes
Members may use any tool (Python, R, Excel, SPSS, etc.). The focus is producing consistent outputs that can be combined into a final shared report.
